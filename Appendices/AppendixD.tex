Did you understand the meaning of & & I couldn’t understand any of them \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
the sliders (e.g.: the sliders for & & I couldn’t understand most of them \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
setting the desired loudness)? & & Some were clear, but others were not \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
& & I could understand most of them \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
& & I could understand all of them \\ \midrule
How did you find the musical output? & & I found the music extremely disconnected or “jumpy” \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
& & The music sounded generally disconnected and I couldn’t enjoy it \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
& & The music sometimes sounded disconnected and sometimes flowing \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
& & Despite some minor issues, the musical experience flowed well \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
& & I really enjoyed the way music was mixed, it “flowed” \\ \midrule \\ \midrule
Have you ever seen or interacted & & Yes \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
with a similar type of software? & & No \\ \midrule

with the music that was played & & Quite dissimilar \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
(i.e., how similar or far was the & & Familiar \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}

Do you think that this way of & & Not at all \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
listening to music is an & & Just in rare cases \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
improvement over the traditional & & Generally not, but I can see its usefulness \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}

& & It's definitely an improvement and I would use it all the time \\ \midrule
Do you think that this player could & & Not at all, it just makes it harder \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
make it easier to explore a huge & & Just in rare cases \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
collection of music? & & Generally not, but sometimes it could be useful \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
& & I think it would make it quite easier \\ \cmidrule(r){3-3}
