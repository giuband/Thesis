\lhead{Chapter 2. \emph{Music Analysis Techniques}} 
The main subject of MIR regards the \textit{extraction and inference of musically meaningful features, indexing of music} (through these features) and the development of \textit{search and retrieval schemes} \cite{downieMIR}. In other terms, the main target of MIR is to make all the music over the world easily accessible to the user \cite{downieMIR}. During the last two decades, several approaches have been developed, which mainly differ in the music perception category of the features they deal with. These categories generally are: \textit{music content}, \textit{music context}, \textit{user properties} and \textit{user context} \cite{gomez14}. \textit{Music content} deal with aspects that are directly inferred by the audio signal (such as melody, rhythmic structure, timbre) while \textit{music context} refers to aspects that are not directly extracted from the signal but are strictly related to it (for example artist, year of release, title, semantic labels). Regarding the user, the difference between \textit{user context} and \textit{user properties} lies on the stability of aspects of the user himself. The former deals with aspects that are subject to frequent changes (such as mood or social context), while the latter refers to aspects that may be considered constant or slowly changing, for instance his music taste or education \cite{gomez14}. \\In this chapter, we will focus on the differences between the categories \textit{music content} and \textit{music context}.
